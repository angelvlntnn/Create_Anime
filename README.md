# Generating Anime Characters using DCGANs and Keras

## Introduction
This project focuses on generating anime characters using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) implemented in Keras. DCGANs are a class of deep learning models used for generating new content, such as images, based on training data.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Keras
- Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCGANs)
- Anime character dataset (e.g., Anime Face Dataset)
